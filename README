Packages provided for the extension of the NIT standard library. In particular, 4 collections are provided based
on the red black tree: TreeSet, TreeMultiset, TreeMap and TreeMultimap. One package provides all the source needed
to make those collections work. The other package (tests), is one for automating regression testing.

Design choices:
	-Minimal convenience for first release-> But the power to do everything.
	-Some kind of conformity with the collections in NIT library has been provided, but no direct plugging under
	 a superclass.
	-Minimal removal facilities through iterators: prevents a lot of confusion and different naming conventions
	 (remove_at can be used to implement remove, remove_once, remove_all, remove_entirely, remove_key, remove_once_key and so on)
	-Retrievals returns iterators. Why? Because it is better suited for NIT than elements, and it just happens
	 to be my favorite way of doing this. Example of why it is better suited: lowest(): Element, if the collection
	 is empty than the proper way of doing this would be to abort the program, since Element might not be nullable.
	 That is ok because the person didn't probably know that the tree is empty. Same as trying to access an out of bounds
	 element on an array. This is a situation where it isn't so black and white:
	 ceiling( e: Element ): Element. Someone would like to know what is the first element
	 closest to e, but higher if e does not exist. Should the program abort because no elements satisfying the condition
	 exists??? Isn't ceiling a way of asking if there is an element higher than e that exists? One could argue that
	 we could provide a has_ceiling method and start bloating the interface this way for every other method we add (floor, lower, higher).
	 There are other ways to handle the problems, but IMHO, the iterator way is the simplest yet most powerful way of doing this
	 (gives a lot of flexibility) and it just happens to be the choice made for removals as well (convenient, isn't it?).
	 Therefore:
	 remove_at( ceiling( e ) ) removes the ceiling, if it exists, does nothing if it doesn't.
	 Alternative NOT chosen:
	 if has_ceiling( e ) then remove( ceiling( e ) ) end
	 This solution isn't perfect. In the example above the client has less code to write. But if he wanted to remove e
	 he would have more code to write:
	 remove_at( find( e ) )
	 Instead of
	 remove( e )
	 Convenient facilities should be added in the future. Another important downfall is that later in this text I propose
	 another iterator for linear unordered access (for manipulating values in maps for example). However, doing this might
	 cause a problem: why should the collection decide what kind of iterator to return? This opens a whole new discussion
	 that is very interesting but out of the scope of this project. A solution would be to return a positional object from which
	 any iterator can be constructed but then again someone could just argue: why would someone want an unordered iterator starting
	 elsewhere than from the root? Open question.
	 

What has been left aside:
 -Support for operations on values for maps. Is it:
 	-Required
 	-Advisable
 -Some convenient methods have been added and some weren't. The choices are mostly arbitrary and further conveniences
  can easily be provided. See next point.
 -All facilities imaginable that uses the subset proposed are still to be implemented. Following are some examples
  and some discussion on what should be considered if they are to be implemented.
 	-For instance, pop_highest does not exist, but can be done like this: 
 	 tree.remove_at( tree.highest() ) or tree.remove_at( tree.reverse_iterator )
  	-Another example: higher and lower methods. (Returns the first element lower or higher than the provided element). Can be done
   	 with floor and ceiling. Example: 
  	 var f = tree.floor( 50 )
  	 if f.item == 50 then f.previous end
  	 #Now f is on the lower element of 50, might be invalid.
  	 In fact, if it is to be implemented, it'll be exactly like that. NOTE that the interface has been designed in
  	 such a way that it works for BOTH multi and single version of trees (floor returns an iterator on the first element
  	 in the ascending order that corresponds to the one provided, the previous one if it does not exist).
 	-Provide an insert_all, for convenience (insert_all( c:Collection...) )
	-Provide a remove_all -> This is more ambiguous. What does remove_all means on a multiset for example? Remove all 
	 occurrences or remove one occurrence of every provided element. Because for a set remove_all surely means the latter.
	 And on a multiset for example, does it mean remove_all_once or remove_every_possible_element_that_matches??? See next
	 point.
	-Is it worth doing something like this: remove_once and remove_entirely for multi versions?
	 Remove entirely can now be done like this:
	 var f = tree.floor( 50 )
	 if f.item == 50 then
		 while f.item == 50 do
		    f = tree.remove_at( 50 )
		 end
	 end
	 Remove once can be done like this:
	 tree.remove_at( tree.find( 50 ) )
	-operator [] on map for convenience.
 -Provide a way to extract all keys in O(n). I'm still not sure what would be the point of that, but it's possible.
 -Extract all values in O(n), same as above.
 -To answer both previous points, maybe it's just better to implement a breadth first iterator or something like
  that that does not provide any order, but guarantees a O(n) iteration.
 

What's left for testing:
-Test with different comparators
-Test multimaps with duplicate keys having different values
